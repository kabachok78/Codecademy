        Dogecoin (DOHJ-koyn or DOHZH-koyn,code: DOGE, symbol: √ê) is a
        cryptocurrency created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson
        Palmer, who decided to create a payment system as a "joke", making fun
        of the wild speculation in cryptocurrencies at the time. It is
        considered both the first "meme coin", and, more specifically, the first
        "dog coin". Despite its satirical nature, some consider it a legitimate
        investment prospect. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog
        from the "doge" meme as its logo and namesake.It was introduced on
        December 6, 2013, and quickly developed its own online community,
        reaching a market capitalization of over $85 billion[a] on May 5,
        2021.It is the current shirt sponsor (sleeve only) of Premier League
        club Watford.

        <h2>History of Creation</h2>
        <article>
          Originally formed as a "joke",[11] Dogecoin was created by IBM
          software engineer Billy Markus and Adobe software engineer Jackson
          Palmer. They wanted to create a peer-to-peer digital currency that
          could reach a broader demographic than Bitcoin. In addition, they
          wanted to distance it from the controversial history of other
          coins.[12] Dogecoin was officially launched on December 6, 2013, and
          within the first 30 days, there were over a million visitors to
          Dogecoin.com.
